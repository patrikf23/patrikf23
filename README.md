Hi, I’m Patrik 

I've been working in hospitality for more than 10years. Now I've decided to move on and start newcareer path in IT industry.

I'm finishing ITnetwork.cz training course at themoment. During this course I was learning how tocode in Java and JavaScript, what are theessentials of fully responsive websites (HTML5,Bootstrap) or understanding the core of OOP.
I would say, the pros of my work experience inhospitality is, that I’m keen to work-hard andunder pressure.

I’ve also learnt how to get alongwith other people both as a team player and thehost. So my communication skills are on very goodlevel. Apart that I spent 3 years in London, where
I could master my English.

I'm more then eager to develop my newlyacquired IT skills and work hard to become highlycompetent programmer.
